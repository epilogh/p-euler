Thought I would get back into python and coding in general through solving some project euler questions. 

These answers have been verified should I push them to the repository, however please do not expect the method for solving these questions to be the most efficient. Bear in mind I am a novice. 

Reach out or create an issue if you feel I made a mistake or even have a suggestion for more efficient solution method. 

Best,

Niamh
