Largest palindrome product

Problem 4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

I was being stupid at first and starting at 100, 1000, and doing the same operation as above
then I stored the multiples in an array, then checked if they were palindromes ...  so bad

"""
for isPal() I was initially making a char array, then reversing it, then comparing it
later found that ::-1 exists, it starts at the end of the strings and creates a slice with each string character
I'm sure it's faster
